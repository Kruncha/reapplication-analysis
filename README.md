# Analysis of College Reapplication Data
Worked with data from a company that helps students reapply to college after having dropped out.  Created a Logistic Regression model to determine which factors are most influential in determining whether a student will reapply.  Used pandas library to query and clean the data.

This README is a work in progress!  It will contain complete details about the project after April 7, 2017.  In the meantime, feel free to peruse the docstrings in reapplication-analysis.py.
